# API Guide

Read this document only for REST API, authentication or frontend/backend contract work.

## Base approach

The backend uses Django REST Framework and the frontend consumes the API through its existing service/client layer.

## Contract rules

- Treat request/response shape as a contract.
- Preserve backwards compatibility unless the requested change intentionally breaks it.
- Keep validation errors predictable.
- Keep pagination consistent with the existing project standard.
- Preserve authentication and organization/tenant authorization.
- Do not expose internal fields or secrets.

## When changing an endpoint

Check:
1. route/router,
2. permissions,
3. serializer/request validation,
4. service/business logic,
5. queryset/selectors,
6. response shape,
7. frontend types/client usage,
8. targeted tests.

## Nursery batch dates

Batch create/update preserves nullable `birth_date`, including non-reproductive
categories such as `Terminação`. Nursery rows expose `idade` as elapsed calendar
days since birth and `prev_crescimento` as birth date plus 70 days. At that date,
the display status is `ready_for_growth`; the phase changes through the existing
transfer operation. Unknown birth dates produce null age and forecast; arrival
date is not a substitute. Older manually registered lots whose birth date was
discarded must have that date entered again.

## Growth batch dates

Growth rows expose `idade` as elapsed days since birth, independently of `dias`
(days in the growth phase). `previsao` is an ISO date derived from the existing
estimated days to reach 60 kg. Batches at or above that weight use today's date;
unknown weight produces a null forecast. The growth table displays age in place
of GPD and formats the forecast as a calendar date.

## Fattening batch dates

Fattening rows expose `idade` as elapsed days since birth. `previsao` is an ISO
date: the recorded `exit_date` takes precedence, otherwise the existing estimate
to reach 110 kg is added to today's local date. Lots already at target weight
use today's date; unknown weight produces a null estimate. The table displays
age instead of GPD and formats the sale forecast as a calendar date.

## Batch technical sheet

Batch details resolve birth dates from the lot and its linked birth/animal/source
records. Manually entered birth dates that were previously discarded still need
to be entered again. `initial_quantity` also uses the registration event for
manually registered lots. `deaths_count` counts recorded batch deaths and linked
maternity mortality, rather than interpreting every quantity reduction as death.
Phase history exposes `entry_weight_kg` and `entry_quantity`, and represents an
open phase once with `is_current=true`. Closed phases recover entry metrics from
the preceding phase or the registration event when available. The sheet uses
these baselines for GPD and feed conversion; missing baselines remain unknown.

## Authentication

The repository documentation indicates JWT-based authentication and optional Google OAuth. Confirm current implementation before changing auth flows.

Security-sensitive auth changes require targeted tests and should not be bundled with unrelated refactors.

## Animal batch sales

`POST /livestock/batches/{id}/register-sale/` accepts `mode` (`whole` or
`partial`), `quantity` (required for partial), manual `weight_kg` (total kg),
`price_per_kg`, `date`, `buyer`, optional `responsible` and `notes`. Whole sales
use the locked batch quantity; manual quantities must not exceed the available quantity. Selling the entire
remaining balance, including in partial mode, finalizes the batch. Stock, operational history and paid revenue are updated
atomically. Sales of the remaining balance mark the batch sold; smaller sales retain active
status and decrease its quantity. Total revenue is weight × price, rounded to cents.
`GET /livestock/batches/sales/` returns the latest 100 pig sales in the current
organization, including historical revenue entries whose weight/price are unknown.

On the final whole sale, the current phase closes on the sale date. A persistent
`Fechamento de Venda do Lote` event freezes `sale_summary`: combined sold quantity,
total sale weight, weighted average weight (total kg / animals sold), revenue,
phase entry baselines, GPD ((final average − entry average) / phase days) and
feed conversion (phase feed kg / total live-weight gain). Missing input records
produce null indicators. Partial sales do not close or overwrite phase metrics.
Batch detail exposes this summary and phase history uses its preserved entry
metrics. Batches with sales cannot be deleted through the batch endpoint; sold
batches remain in the inventory report and their sheets open from the general
batch report. Prior sales without a closure event retain their existing history.

Printed batch sheets contain operational data only: no feed prices or financial
analysis. The general batch report opens a separate cost detail via
`GET /livestock/batches/{id}/financial-details/`. This tenant-scoped endpoint
lists recorded feed costs, vaccination cost snapshots, clinical treatment costs,
non-cancelled batch expenses and applications without stored costs, including
source batches once. It returns category totals, total recorded cost, per-animal
and per-kg-of-total-weight costs, and a count of missing costs. Missing costs are
not imputed and are excluded from the total. This does not change permissions.
