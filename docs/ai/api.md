# API Guide

Read this document only for REST API, authentication or frontend/backend contract work.

## Base approach

The backend uses Django REST Framework and the frontend consumes the API through its existing service/client layer.

## Contract rules

- Treat request/response shape as a contract.
- Preserve backwards compatibility unless the requested change intentionally breaks it.
- Keep validation errors predictable.
- Keep pagination consistent with the existing project standard.
- Preserve authentication and organization/tenant authorization.
- Do not expose internal fields or secrets.

## When changing an endpoint

Check:
1. route/router,
2. permissions,
3. serializer/request validation,
4. service/business logic,
5. queryset/selectors,
6. response shape,
7. frontend types/client usage,
8. targeted tests.

## Nursery batch dates

Batch create/update preserves nullable `birth_date`, including non-reproductive
categories such as `Terminação`. Nursery rows expose `idade` as elapsed calendar
days since birth and `prev_crescimento` as birth date plus 70 days. At that date,
the display status is `ready_for_growth`; the phase changes through the existing
transfer operation. Unknown birth dates produce null age and forecast; arrival
date is not a substitute. Older manually registered lots whose birth date was
discarded must have that date entered again.

## Growth batch dates

Growth rows expose `idade` as elapsed days since birth, independently of `dias`
(days in the growth phase). `previsao` is an ISO date derived from the existing
estimated days to reach 60 kg. Batches at or above that weight use today's date;
unknown weight produces a null forecast. The growth table displays age in place
of GPD and formats the forecast as a calendar date.

## Fattening batch dates

Fattening rows expose `idade` as elapsed days since birth. `previsao` is an ISO
date: the recorded `exit_date` takes precedence, otherwise the existing estimate
to reach 110 kg is added to today's local date. Lots already at target weight
use today's date; unknown weight produces a null estimate. The table displays
age instead of GPD and formats the sale forecast as a calendar date.

## Batch technical sheet

Batch details resolve birth dates from the lot and its linked birth/animal/source
records. Manually entered birth dates that were previously discarded still need
to be entered again. `initial_quantity` also uses the registration event for
manually registered lots. `deaths_count` counts recorded batch deaths and linked
maternity mortality, rather than interpreting every quantity reduction as death.
Phase history exposes `entry_weight_kg` and `entry_quantity`, and represents an
open phase once with `is_current=true`. Closed phases recover entry metrics from
the preceding phase or the registration event when available. The sheet uses
these baselines for GPD and feed conversion; missing baselines remain unknown.

## Authentication

The repository documentation indicates JWT-based authentication and optional Google OAuth. Confirm current implementation before changing auth flows.

Security-sensitive auth changes require targeted tests and should not be bundled with unrelated refactors.
